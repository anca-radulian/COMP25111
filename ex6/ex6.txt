I modified the value of "p_shm" to be equal to 0 in the receive.c file as it is
shared with the send.c one where there is needed a value different to 1
so the program will print a check message and end. I order to give receive.c
enough time to change the value, I used in send.c an sleep(2) method.

Changes in the receive.c file

p_shm[0] = 0;
release_shm(p_shm);		   	// Free shared memory
destroy_shm(shm_id);			// ... and destroy it
exit(0);

Changes in the receive.c file

while (p_shm[0] == 1) sleep(2) ;		// Wait
printf("Send: message received.\n");

  release_shm(p_shm);			// Free shared memory
  }
