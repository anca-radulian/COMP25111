//---------- Stage 0 ----------------------
all three dinners will have the same sleep

we will use it to k know if the fork is picked first or second

they are put in reverse order so that will not be swapped

//--------- Stage 1 -----------------------
as the actions are made in the same time the diners will be in deadlock When
they try to pick up the forks because they are 'used' by another one.

//--------- Stage 2 ----------------------
the first fork is synchronised but after that if a diner tries to pick up the fork
it will be unable to know if it succeeded to pick it up

//--------- Stage 3 ----------------------
the dinners will synchronize the way they pick up their forks but the deadlock risk
is still present.

//--------- Stage 4 ----------------------
the deadlock is avoided as the last diner takes the fork from its right when available
and the rest of the diners will take their left ones.
